        black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They are
        often exhibited in "<a href=​"/​wiki/​Poultry" title=​"Poultry">​poultry​</a>​" shows, and appear in various colors. In
        addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly
        temperament. It is among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally "<a href=​"/​wiki/​Broodiness" title=​"Broodiness">​broody​</a>​", and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only
        about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their
        broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, but like any pet,
        should be handled with care.
